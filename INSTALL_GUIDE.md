# How to Install ReactApp on Windows

Follow these simple steps to install the application.

### Step 1: Download and Unzip the Installer

1.  Download the installer package. It will be a zip file named something like `ReactApp-Release-v1.0.0.zip`.
    *   **[Click here to download the latest version]** *(You will need to replace this with a link to your installer file)*
2.  Go to your **Downloads** folder, right-click on the zip file, and select **"Extract All..."**. Click **"Extract"** to unzip the files into a new folder.

### Step 2: Run the Installer

1.  Open the new folder that was created.
2.  Inside, you will find a file named **`Install.bat`**.
3.  **Double-click** the **`Install.bat`** file to start the installation.

4.  A window may pop up asking for your permission to make changes. This is expected. Click **"Yes"** to continue.
5.  A black command window will appear and automatically handle the entire installation.

### Step 3: Launch the App

Once the installation is complete, the window will say "Press any key to exit...".

You can now open the **Start Menu** and find **ReactApp** to launch it, just like any other application.
